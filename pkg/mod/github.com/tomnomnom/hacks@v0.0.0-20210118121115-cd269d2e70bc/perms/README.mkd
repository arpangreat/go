# perms

A tool for generating lots of permutations of lines provided on stdin.

**WARNING**: if you provide too many lines of input, specify too high of a depth, or too many separators (or any combination of those),
you will produce more combinations than you have RAM/disk space/time left on earth. Don't say I didn't warn you.
